# HDAs: Info

**Rollback Versions** takes a USD stage as input and provides an easy interface to roll back Usd.Prims with 'version' variant sets. The code for this HDA is [here](https://github.com/david-rollinson/Houdini-Toolsets/blob/main/scripts/rollback_prim_versions.py)

**Note:** these HDAs are in expanded format in effort to remain VCS-friendly. Assuming you have the hotl utility installed this can be compressed to .hda format using the following, 

    hotl -l <INPUT_DIR> <OUTPUT.hda>
